Using LCM tools to record (log) or play LCM messages.

Make the scripts executable:\
`chmod +x record_lcm.sh play_lcm.sh`


Record (log) all LCM messages in the current directory:\
`./record_lcm.sh`

This runs "lcm-logger" and keeps recording until one press Ctrl-C.


Play back a recorded LCM log:\
`./play_lcm.sh <path-to-lcm-log>`

This runs "lcm-logplayer-gui" on the provided log file and keeps playing until one press Ctrl-C (or close the GUI).


Notes:\
Depending on the modules, one may need to change the Playback Channel name(s) in the GUI.\
This folder's .gitignore ignores everything except:
- lcm_logs.md
- record_lcm.sh
- play_lcm.sh
